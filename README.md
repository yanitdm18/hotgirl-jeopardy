## Wireframed Plans for Design

-The Hot Girl Jeopardy web application consists of a main title at the top, boldly displaying the name of the game. Just below the title, there's a score display section indicating the current score. Adjacent to the score display, a reset button is available to reset the game.

The main content of the page is organized into five categories, each with a unique theme. Within each category, there are cells representing questions of varying point values. These cells are arranged in a grid format, providing a visually appealing game board.

As users click on a cell, a question display section appears in the center of the screen. This section prompts users with a question related to the selected cell, accompanied by an input field for answering. A submit button allows users to submit their answers.

Additionally, there are popup displays for both correct and incorrect answers. When a user answers a question, a popup appears, providing feedback. For correct answers, the popup congratulates the user and mentions the points earned. Conversely, for incorrect answers, the popup notifies the user of points deducted.

The design maintains a consistent visual theme with hot pink borders for cells, light coral borders for category headers, and a vibrant background color. The font is styled with the "Protest Strike" font from Google Fonts, adding a unique and stylish touch to the title.

Overall, the wireframe aims to create an engaging and visually appealing interface for the Hot Girl Jeopardy game, providing a seamless and enjoyable user experience.
